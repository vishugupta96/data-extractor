0,Pyae Phyo Aung,2 months ago,"I did similar moves when it comes to the drop. This song has been on repeat for 4-5 days since it came out and the chores touched me in the similar dance that he did. Not too hardcore not not too swaying soft. Lauv always speaks through his music and his lyrics helps me through hardest time. I cannot miss any of his songs! Love this too. I’m just thankful that you exist, Lauv.",88
